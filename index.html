                <h2>This is Me.....</h2>
                <p>My name is Michael Fehdrau. I was born deaf into an American-German family and grew up learning both in deaf schools, mainstream hearing schools, and with a speech therapist for 16 years, which helped me speak clearly even though my first language is ASL.<br>
                    As a child, I dreamed of being an engineer or architect, inspired by my grandfather who built homes. Life took me in a different direction, and I later studied fashion design, creating clothes for all.<br>
                    Over the years, I’ve worked various jobs and discovered a love for technology. Web design and coding sparked my curiosity about how things function and connect.
                    <br>Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, painting, drawing, cooking, sightseeing, and visiting museums.
                    <br>Most people assume I’m hearing, but the truth is—I’m proudly deaf.

                <h2>Becoming AI Builder.</A></h2>
                <p>My goal is to become an AI builder and a software engineer on the side. I’m working to learn coding well enough to build functional systems, and — if I get the results I want — I plan to challenge myself with machine learning.<br>
                When AI first hit the public eye, many people panicked or worried it would take jobs and change everything. I don’t see it that way. AI can be a helpful companion that supports our work and makes life better when used responsibly. It’s not cheating; it’s a powerful tool that sits by your side and amplifies what you can do.<br>
                ChatGPT was my first real introduction to AI, and it sparked my curiosity. As I learn more and watch others use it, I’m starting to like it more and more. Technology is one of the biggest markets today, and I believe mastering these tools will open meaningful opportunities and help me grow in my career.</p>

                <h2>Experiences that I Learned.</h2>
                <p>All my life, I’ve loved creating — from drawing and painting to drafting houses and buildings. Those early hobbies shaped my path. I earned an AA degree in Fashion Design and later a BFA in Visual Communication. Finding work in fashion or design wasn’t easy, but I started from the bottom as a freelancer, knowing I had to begin somewhere.<br>
                When I moved to New York City, I pursued both fashion and graphic/web design. Most of my opportunities came in fashion, where I could sew, sketch, and draft clothing patterns. That became the core of my career in NYC.<br>
                Still, I never stopped learning. I explored technology online, earning certificates in UX design, HTML5, CSS3, and even a bit of JavaScript and Python. My curiosity drives me to keep building skills, and today my focus is learning AI — to see where it can take me and how I can grow into a successful future.</p>
